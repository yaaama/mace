# mace is a simple emacs wrapper

I made this script in order to make life easier for myself.
I was tired of having to type in emacsclient and having to kill the daemon and restart it all manually so I made mace to make it much easier.

Execute `mace -h` to get a list of options.

I will add to this script when I need to, but it will remain a simple program.
