* mace

*mace* is a simple shell script for interacting with doom emacs, emacsclient and the emacs daemon.

I will add to this script when I need to, but it will remain a simple program.


* What is it for?

I made this script to easily start up the emacs daemon, restart it, perform doom commands and just make it easier to open up emacsclient in either terminal or gui mode.

Please note that you will need dunst in order to receive a notification for when the daemon has restarted.



* Options

- Execute =mace -h= to get a list of options.

- =-sr=   Restarts emacs daemon and notifies when complete.
- =-t=    Opens emacs in terminal mode.
- =-g=    Opens emacs in GUI mode.
- =-h=    Prints out available commands.
- =-deb= Starts emacs with =--debug-init= flag.
- =-du=   Alias for =doom upgrade=.
- =-ds=   Alias for =doom sync=.
- =-db=   Alias for =doom build=.
- =-dp= Alias for =doom purge=.
- =-dd= Alias for =doom doctor=.
