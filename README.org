* mace

*mace* is a simple shell script for interacting with doom emacs, emacsclient and the emacs daemon.
_
I will add to this script when I need to, but it will remain a simple program.


* What is it for?

I made this script to easily start up the emacs daemon, restart it, perform doom commands and just make it easier to open up emacsclient in either terminal or gui mode.

Please note that you will need dunst in order to receive a notification for when the daemon has restarted.



* Options

Execute =mace -h= to get a list of options.

=-sr=   Restarts emacs daemon and notifies when complete.

=-du=   Alias for =doom upgrade=.

=-ds=   Alias for =doom sync=

=-t=    Opens emacs in terminal mode.

=-g=    Opens emacs in GUI mode.

=-db=   Alias for =doom build=

=-h=    Prints out available commands.
